Cursor
----------
When we try to get information from database it doesn't come 
directly to us until we say so.Information comes as a meta file(cursor).
This meta file contains information about our information that we got from 
database. 
We get cursor from database not actual info until we ask it.
When we execute db.collection.find() we get a cursor not actual data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we only wanted to printa specific value of all data-
db.collection.find.forEach( (obj) =>{printjson(obj.att)}) 

Even for a specific value this is a costly operation because
once we execute that command all the data arefetched and are put
 in cursor and then we are looping through whole objects to get email.
(There is no need of getting everything from database)

To make this operation cost efficient we will pass some parameters to .find()
function-
(i) It provides condition for extracting data like where clause in sql
(ii) Second parameter is what are info. that should be returned by database
By default it is everything , but we can overwrite it.
We can make attributes we want to fetch as 1 and leave rest which will be 
by default 0. _id will by default be 1.

db.collection.find({},{att:1})
This statement will return _id and attribute set to 1

db.collection.find({},{att:1,_id:0,att1:1})
will not return _id and return att and att1


To convert returned things to array
db.collection.find({},{att:1,_id:0,att1:1}).toArray()
