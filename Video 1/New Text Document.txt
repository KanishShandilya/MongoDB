1. show dbs->All database being created in this system

2. use databasename
switched to db databasename
after this even if we run show dbs ,it will not show 
database we just created,until we donot add some 
collection in our database it will not create our database.

3.db.studentData.insertOne({
	"name":"Kanish",
	"email":"kanishshandilya@gmail.com",
})

studentData is collection name
insertOne() is method which insert one bson data
insertMany() is method which insert multiple data

We need to be careful while naming collection
 'studentData' because if we even change case 

4.db.studentData.find()

studentData is collection
find() will give all the data present in our database
in collection
db.studentData.find().pretty() will show data
 in more readable format.
it will denote different collection of our database.
