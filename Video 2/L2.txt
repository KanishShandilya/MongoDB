Our JSON object is changed into BSON data and then
it is saved.Saving BSON data is much more efficient 
than saving JSON data.

BSON is a larger set that represents JSON as 
well as some other features.

BSON is JSON in Binary-encoded format.


" " in keys are not necessary but it totally fine even we
are putting it.But if we have space in key feilds
we need to give "".


Object Id:
In JSON data ObjectId is not recognized as a valid field.
In BSON,it is valid. So when we insert in database
 it shows-
{
"acknowledged":true,
"insertedId":ObjectId("uugucf67tergugcf47t")
}

It is aloso a validation that our data is saved in form of 
BSON not JSON.

After saving if we fetch the data from our database 
collection using -
db.studentData.find().pretty()

We will see that '_id' field is generated by MongoDB
automatically.It is a unique identifier.It is a value
of ObjectId in a long String.We can also provide some
of these unique id as long as they are unique.

To provide our own -id-

db.studentData.insertOne({
name:"Mayank",
email:"mayank@gmail.com",
_id:"123abc-w"
})

Our _id for this object will be our own generated string
 instead of ObjectId("jjsfyuer743iuewgf") provided by 
system.If we try to insert different record with same
_id it will generate error.Giving own _id is not advisable.
